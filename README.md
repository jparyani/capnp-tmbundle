# capnp-tmbundle

## Development

If you want to help developing this package you will need [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) installed to be able to compile the `capnp.tmLanguage` file from `capnp.language.yml`. To install grunt:

    npm install -g grunt

Install this project's dependencies (only needs to be done once):

    npm install

And then run grunt:

    grunt watch
